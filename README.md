<b>Event Manager</b><br>
Assignment<br>

The following information is stored for each event: name, location, start date and time, end date and time (all are required).

The application should allow you to read all events, create a new event, update an existing event and delete it.

If you want to apply for the Front-end internship, please use either mBaaS (e.g. Kinvey) or API (e.g. Mockaroo).
